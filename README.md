# FoundryUnstripped

Unity project for building partially stripped [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) library for [Foundry](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/foundry/about) game.

The main idea thx to [@erkle64](https://github.com/erkle64) is to get stripped Harmony library but with code necessary to make mod patches.

At this moment Foundry using [Unity 2021.3.20f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.20).
